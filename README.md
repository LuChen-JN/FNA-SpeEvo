## Introduction
A deep learning model for predicting interactions between nucleic acids and small molecules

## System Requirements
This model is supported for any standard computer and operating system (Windows/macOS/Linux) with enough RAM to run. 
The source code developed in Python 3.6.13 using PyTorch 1.10.2. The required python dependencies are given below. 
To avoid conflicts between the various python packages, we recommend using the following versions of packages：
```
torch = 1.10.2
dgllife = 0.3.2
numpy = 1.19.2
scikit-learn = 0.24.2
pandas = 1.2.4
rdkit = 2020.09.1.0
matplotlib = 3.3.4

```
